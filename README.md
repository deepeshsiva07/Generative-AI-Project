# Explorating Film Names Using Generative AI
# Overview
Exploring Film Names Using Generative AI involves leveraging artificial intelligence techniques, such as Markov Chain models or neural networks, to generate new film names based on patterns learned from a dataset of existing film names especially with Tensorflow and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). This process includes: Data Collection, Pre Processing, Generation, Model Training...
# Key Features
1. Model Flexibility: The ability to use various generative AI models such as Markov Chains, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers, allowing flexibility in generating film names based on different approaches.
2. Learning Patterns: Generative AI models learn patterns and relationships within the dataset of existing film names, enabling them to generate new names that mimic the style and characteristics of real film titles.
3. Creativity: The AI-generated film names often exhibit creativity by combining words and phrases in unique ways, sometimes producing novel and intriguing titles that humans might not have thought of.
4. Customizability: Users can tailor the generative AI models to suit their preferences by adjusting parameters such as temperature (for controlling the randomness of outputs), training data size, or model architecture.
5. Iterative Improvement: The ability to iteratively train and refine the generative AI models based on feedback, resulting in improved performance and more realistic outputs over time.
6. Real-time Generation: Users can interactively generate film names in real-time, providing prompts or constraints to guide the generation process and explore different possibilities.
